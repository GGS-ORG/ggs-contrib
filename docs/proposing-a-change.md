ggs.wiki uses GitHub to store and control its content. If you already familiar with git and know how to create pull request then you can skip this article.

## Proposing a change...

... is easy as one, two , three:
1. [Edit an article](#edit-an-article)
2. [Open a pull request](#open-a-pull-request)
3. [Have the changes approved](#have-the-changes-approved)

Below are the details for each of the steps.

### Edit an article

Everything starts with an `edit` button: ![Edit](https://i.imgur.com/49NCrpV.png). Find it on any article and click to propose an update. It will redirect you to the proper article source hosted on GitHub and ask to log in there. If you don't have an account, you'll be asked to create one. If asked, press the big green button `Fork this repository and propose changes`

Then you should see the article's source formatted in [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

Make desired modifications and save them by pressing yet another green button at the bottom `Propose file change`
